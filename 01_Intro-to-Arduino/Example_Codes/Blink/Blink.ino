/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
  
  Delay works by pausing the programm for a certain time
  This is called blocking. Check the Serial Output to see how the delay slows down 
  the operation for the counter variable which counts the amounts of programm loops the arduino has done.
